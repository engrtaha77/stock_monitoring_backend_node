You're now describing two important inventory flows, based on your two roles: shopkeeper and customer.

Let’s break both down clearly and explain what happens and what you should do.

🧭 Your Scenario Recap
✅ 1. Shopkeeper Orders from Admin
Shopkeeper creates an order → goes to Admin

Admin accepts → invoice is generated

Inventory is reduced from Admin's stock

Shopkeeper receives products → this becomes part of shopkeeper's own inventory

🧠 You are treating each shop as a sub-inventory. Admin has central stock, shopkeepers have theirs.

✅ 2. Customer Walks In (Point of Sale)
The customer does not place an order

They walk in, buy items directly

Shopkeeper creates an invoice on the spot (cash or credit)

Inventory is reduced from the shopkeeper’s stock

✅ This is like a regular retail sale → you should create the invoice directly, not an order.

🎯 So What Should You Do?
🧾 A. When Shopkeeper Buys From Admin
✅ Order is created from shopkeeper → admin

✅ Admin approves → invoice generated

✅ Admin's inventory is reduced

✅ Optionally, shopkeeper’s inventory is increased

js
Copy
Edit
AdminStock.quantity -= X;
ShopkeeperStock.quantity += X;
You can store this in a ShopProduct model if you're tracking stock per shop.

💰 B. When Customer Buys From Shopkeeper
✅ No order

✅ Invoice is created immediately

✅ Shopkeeper’s inventory is reduced

✅ You store customerId if it's a known customer, or leave it blank (walk-in)

✅ Payment method: "cash" or "credit"

This mimics a cash register / POS system.

🏗️ How to Handle This in Your System
🔁 You Now Need to Manage Two Inventories:
Admin Inventory (central warehouse)

Shop Inventory (for each shop)

🔄 When admin invoices to a shop, transfer products from Admin → Shop
🔄 When shop invoices to a customer, deduct from Shop’s inventory

🔧 Suggested Schema Adjustment
You should have:

js
Copy
Edit
// Separate stock per shop
ShopProduct: {
  shopId: ObjectId,
  productId: ObjectId,
  quantity: Number
}
When:

Admin sells to shopkeeper → increase this shop's ShopProduct.quantity

Shopkeeper sells to customer → decrease this shop's ShopProduct.quantity

✅ Final Summary:
Flow	Create Order?	Create Invoice?	Inventory Reduced From
Shopkeeper orders from Admin	✅ Yes	✅ Yes (by admin)	✅ Admin inventory
Customer buys from Shopkeeper	❌ No	✅ Yes (POS)	✅ Shopkeeper inventory

✅ What You Should Build Next:
Add ShopProduct model to track each shop’s inventory

Ensure invoice logic updates correct inventory (admin or shopkeeper)

Allow shopkeepers to invoice customers directly without orders

Use paymentMethod: "cash" or "credit" to track on-spot sales
